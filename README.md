I frist saw a [morphing clock project at the Hackaday webiste](https://hackaday.com/2018/07/10/morphing-digital-clock-will-show-you-a-good-time/) when I was researching how to drive LED Matrix panels.  I noted this, and then moved on to making the [LED Matrix driver for the P2](https://github.com/ironsheep/p2-HUB75-LED-Matrix-Driver).

Later, after creating the HUB75 Adapter, more work on the driver, etc. I decided to take a short break and looked into the means for driving this morphing. 

This project is my nod to **Hari Wiguna**'s [HariFun #165 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DddhMh6kJc) but I chose to implement this using table driven animations with the table having been generated by python using "segment proximity" along with "segment changes from digit to digit" and using the types of animations that Hari used.

**<= This is a work in progress =>**

## Credits

- I was encouraged by the challenge found in the [HariFun #165 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DddhMh6kJc). I'm not alone in this as others have shown videos (e.g., [the bornach Generalizing... video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJZRKHw6bcg)) but not always provided  links to their code.  In my case I wanted to demonstrate that there was a way to study all the animations needed and then a short routine could then generate the needed animation descriptions.  This can then be easily extended with a tiny bit more work to cover all 22 alpha-numeric digits that bornach used.
